            <p>The Prun have had a long history of <em>religious civil conflict</em> dating from the early periods of history on their world to their ascent as an FTL capable civilization. Many factions have engaged in espionage and gang-like violence with each other even in times of peace and stability. <br>
            These most prominent of these beligerants include: <br></p>
            <ul>
                <li>The Numistic Order</li>
                <li>The Epoth Church</li>
                <li>The Cults of Lavram</li>
            </ul>
            <p>These orders have differing amount of influence and power in Prun society at large, but their tactics tend to be the same. Protests and sit ins outside of eachother's places of worship, attempted assassinations of Religious figures, and harrassment of each others religious followers. The Government of the modern Prun State, the Coalition of Prun Nations, have attempted to curb violence and provide equal representation of each major religious group within the Government, but officials within the government being caught supporting their respective religions in their efforts to undermine their enemies has only slowed this process, and has contributed to the degradation of the Prun on the galactic stage. Travel to Prun Space is often banned due to the unsafe conditions and aggressive missionary work done on tourists by the Numistic Order and the Cults of Lavram, as well as the violent purges done by extremist Epoch Church members. It is unknown what a solution to the Religious Conflicts of Prun could look like, if there is one at all, and many of the common folk in the Space Nation fear it could lead to civil war, and eventual complete subjugation by its neighbors.</p>

            <h2>The Mutual History of the Cyrzni and the Pyorun</h2> 
            <aside><em>By Jonathan Grama &mdash; Posted October 17th, 2022</em></aside>
            <p><img src="images/CyrzniPyorun.png" alt="An Image of the Pyorun Species"></p>
            <p><strong>This blog post contains imagery from Stellaris by Paradox Interactive.<br></strong></p>
            <p>The Pyorun and the Cyrzni are two humanoid alien species that occupy different life-holding worlds in the Ztaltha. They occupy the worlds of Dlenitz, and Abyzh, respectively. The 2 alien races discovered each other due to a resource crisis on the Cyrzni homeworld of Abyzh. Space travel was a seen as way to solve the resource crisis on Cyrzni as it was theorized the green planet of Delnitz that orbited next to theirs to be full of resources. There was just one problem, the Pyorun who lived on Dlenitz. <br> 
            The Pyorun, at the time, were engaged in a planet-wide total war between competing economic alliances.They had detected radiowaves from the Cyrzni homeworld earlier in their history, and the Cyrzni has known about the Pyorun for far longer due to their more advanced technology. The only thing that changed when the Cyrzni contacted the Pyorun is now the general populace of each planet would now be fully aware of each other and formal relations would be begin. Pyorun responses to Cyrzni contact was cordial at first, each side of the conflict wishing to open relations in exchange for sharing technology, possibly to give them an edge in the war.<br>
            The Cyrzni would ultimately decide that playing politics with the Cyrzni would take far too long, as the Cyrzni resource crisis was too pressing to play sides, and started to attack the planet en masse in an attempt to quickly subjugate the population. This would ultimately prove un successful, as the Cyrzni completely failed to realize the Pyorun had secretly developed nuclear-capable missiles, which were quickly sent into space to destroy the Cyzrni fleet. What erupted next was a year long interplanetary nuclear war between the two planets, completely devastating the two species. What comes next will be discussed in an upcoming blog-post, the History of The Yanagi.</p>
