            <p>Hello, and welcome to my blog! This blog was made for my MI-349 class. It will contain some of my ramblings about worldbuilding ideas I have for a sci-fi setting I have been thinking about, mainly because I don't have much else to talk about. I suck at art, so I like to extapolate backstories, biologies, and cultures based off of Alien Portraits and Scenarios from the games Stellaris and The Fermi Paradox. <br>
            <strong>All art from these games on this website belong to their respective developers and publishers, I do not own these portraits.</strong><br>
            Some things you can expect to find in this blog include: </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Speculative Biology</li>
                <li>Fictional Historical Accounts</li>
                <li>Governmental Structure</li>
                <li>Accounts of Fictional Wars</li>
                <li>...And Much More!</li>
            </ul>

            <p>My name is Jonathan Grama and I am a game design Major at MSU. I am into many nerdy hobbies and Worldbuilding is only one of them. I really had no idea what to do for this blog, so I just went with something I had been intending to do anyways, build a sort of repository for my WorldBuilding Ideas in a permanent place. I hope you enjoy whatever I end up writing on this website, and that I dont forget this site exists in the next week or so. Here is a silly picture of me with Pink Hair.</p>
